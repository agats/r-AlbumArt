Album Art App
=============

This fully client side web app will display popular album covers from the subreddit.
I started this project to better learn the RequireJS.

How to run
----------
  Open ```./index.html``` in your any browser.

Road map
--------
Let's re-use this app to test out other new and interesting javascript frameworks.

TODO
----
* Clean up HTML
* Semantic HTML
	* Clean up RequireJS implementation, start application from the RequireJS script include.
* Clean up JS
	* Break ```./js/jsonp.js``` into CommonJS modules
* Create javascript unit tests
